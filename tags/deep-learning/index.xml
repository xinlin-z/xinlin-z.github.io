      <description>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neuron networks (CNN) have been revolutionized image-related Artificial Intellegence (AI) tasks. This kind of neuron network architectures have been obtained huge success. Furthermore, CNNs are very interesting. They have many design elements and variants you could play with. Academic researches might pursue a beauty of purity and emphasize the unique feature they proposed. However, in industry application, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary to build a network pure. It&amp;rsquo;s highly possible to combine all necessary design elements together. However, we should have a deep understand of all these design elements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While training a model, a few important mathematical tricks have to be employed. Normalization and regularization techiniques belong to them. They are very important to successfully train models, and they are often confusing and sometimes hard to understand the details as well. Additionally, learning rate scheduling is also very important while training models, especially large ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;normalization-vs-regularization&#34;&gt;Normalization vs Regularization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it simple, normalization is applied on data. Before training a model, data should be normalized. There are a few irresistible benefits to do it. It stablizes the training process, speeds up model convergence significantly, and improve model&amp;rsquo;s generalization capability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
